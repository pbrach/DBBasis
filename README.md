# SQLite-CodeFirst-Base

Ever wanted a solution with a integrated realtional database that needs zero configuration?

If so: clone this, hit build and your SQLite database is readily accessible via entity framework database first.

For me this is to be used as a template solution for further small projects that require data persistence. Still in the future I'd like to improve the automatisms in this solution to be a bit more comfy. Also it would be nice to use EF-6 model first approach to use the edmx designer as a nice table designer for SQLite.
